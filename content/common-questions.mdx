# Common Questions About Aixster: Your Path to Global Reach Explained

At Aixster, we understand that embarking on a journey to a multilingual web presence can bring a host of questions. We're here to provide clear, comprehensive answers to help you leverage Aixster to its fullest potential.

### What is Aixster's Visual Editor and how does it work?

The Aixster Visual Editor is an intuitive, user-friendly interface designed to make managing your multilingual content as simple as possible. Instead of complex code or backend configurations, you can directly edit and translate content on your live website. This 'what you see is what you get' approach allows you to preview changes in real-time for each language, ensuring consistent branding and accurate translations across all versions of your site. Our visual editor eliminates the need for technical expertise, empowering anyone to manage their international content effectively.

### How does Aixster handle Multilingual SEO?

Aixster is built from the ground up with multilingual SEO in mind. We implement best practices to ensure your translated content ranks well in search engines for each target language. This includes proper `<hreflang>` tag implementation, which tells search engines about the different language versions of your page. We also support language-specific URLs and provide tools to optimize meta titles and descriptions for each translation. With Aixster, your international audience can find you, no matter their language or location.

### What kind of Multilingual Site Structure does Aixster support?

Flexibility is key, and Aixster offers robust support for various multilingual site structures. Whether you prefer subdomains (e.g., `es.yourdomain.com`), subdirectories (e.g., `yourdomain.com/es/`), or even distinct top-level domains (e.g., `yourdomain.es`), Aixster can seamlessly integrate with your chosen setup. Our platform ensures that all language versions are correctly linked and discoverable by search engines, maintaining a clean and efficient site architecture. This adaptability allows you to select the structure that best suits your business goals and existing infrastructure.

### How does Visitor Auto-Redirection work with Aixster?

Aixster's visitor auto-redirection feature enhances the user experience by automatically directing visitors to the most appropriate language version of your website based on their browser settings or geographical location. This intelligent redirection ensures that your audience immediately encounters content in a language they understand, reducing bounce rates and improving engagement. You have control over these redirection rules, allowing for customization based on your specific needs and target markets. It's a subtle yet powerful way to make your international visitors feel at home on your site.
